    <h1>Hello, English 388</h1>

    Aside from academics, some of my hobbies include boudlering, tennis, and playing computer 
    games. Some fun facts about me are that I speak Italian fluently and I have student pilots 
    license. In the future, I hope to work in the medical field or in biotech.</p>
